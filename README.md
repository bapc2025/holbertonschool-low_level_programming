learning to make libraries

    A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
        Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed
    Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
        Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
    Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
        Write a blog post on C static libraries. It should cover.
